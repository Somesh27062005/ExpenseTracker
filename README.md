💸 Expense Tracker App — MERN Stack

A full-stack web application to track your expenses and income. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).
Allows users to record expenses/income, view summary and balance, and manage transactions — all via a clean UI + REST API.

## ✅ Features

👤 User authentication (signup / login)

💰 Add new transactions (expense or income)

📝 View list of all transactions

📊 Display total balance, total expenses and total income

✏️ Edit / Update existing transactions

❌ Delete transactions

🌐 Responsive frontend built with React

🔄 Backend using Express + MongoDB to store and manage data

(Add or remove features here depending on what your actual app supports: e.g. categories, filtering, charts, data export, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Project Structure

Frontend: React (or whichever React setup you used — CRA / Vite / etc.)

Backend: Node.js + Express.js

Database: MongoDB (local or cloud — e.g. MongoDB Atlas)

ORM / ODM: Mongoose (or whichever library you used)

Auth (if implemented): JSON Web Tokens (JWT) / sessions (depending on your code)

## 📊 What I Learned / Why This Project

Working on this Expense Tracker App helped me to:

- Build a full-stack MERN application and connect frontend/backend seamlessly  
- Use MongoDB + Mongoose to store and manage data  
- Handle CRUD operations for transactions (create, read, update, delete)  
- Manage React state and API calls to reflect real-time data  
- Implement user authentication and secure routes (if auth is included)  


## 💡 Possible Improvements / Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas you might want to add as your project evolves:

- Add categories for transactions (e.g. Food, Transport, Bills, etc.)  
- Add date filters / month-wise or week-wise summary & reports  
- Show charts or graphs for spending patterns (pie chart, bar chart, etc.)  
- Add ability to export data (CSV, Excel) or backup transactions  
- Add user profile / settings  
- Add dark/light theme or custom UI enhancements  
- Improve mobile responsiveness and overall UI/UX  
- Add tests (unit, integration, end-to-end)  
- Deploy full app to production (backend + frontend)
